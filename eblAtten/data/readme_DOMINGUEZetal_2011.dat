Table by A. Dominguez for the Fermi Collaboration on Jun 13, 2012; Optical depths due to EBL absorption from the model presented by Dominguez et al. 2011
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.410.2556D

Changes by Luis Reyes (lreyes04@calpoly.edu):

- Set optical depth to zero if value in original table less than 1e-6 (in order to remove negative values such as -1e-34, possibly the result of interpolation by the 
author).

- Remove table rows for energies greater than 31.2 TeV
